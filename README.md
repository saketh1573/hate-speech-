# hate-speech-
project to detect hatespeech and if possiable ban/terminate the users

this is a project based on data science and machine learning where the data is first cleared using toolkits such as stop words and nltk(Natural Language Toolkit) which brings all the words into its natural forms such as "driving" will be made "drive" and in the stop words it removes unnecessary words such as "a","an","the" etc... soo that the algorithm doesnt focus more on grammer rather focus more on the words.

then the data is loaded into the code and through a series of changes the sentences are brought down to its finest forms removing all unnecessary links, punctuation etc. after this tha machine learning algorithm divides the data into test and train where we use train to train the module and test dataset are used to test weather the module is correctly trained or nor.

after the training, on testing i have got a test accuracy of 87.59 percentage, which is not too bad for a start.
