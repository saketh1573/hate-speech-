# hate-speech
This project aims to detect hate speech and, if possible, take action to ban or terminate users who engage in such behavior. It utilizes data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and classify text data.

##Project-Description
The primary goal of this project is to develop a hate speech detection system using data science and machine learning methodologies. The system processes textual data by applying various techniques, such as removing stop words and utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to bring words into their base forms. By eliminating unnecessary words and standardizing the text, the algorithm can focus more on the underlying meaning of the words rather than grammatical variations.

The project involves loading the processed data into the code and performing further transformations on the sentences to extract the most relevant information. This process includes removing unnecessary links, punctuation, and other non-essential elements. Subsequently, a machine learning algorithm is employed to divide the data into training and testing sets. The training dataset is used to train the model, while the test dataset assesses the accuracy of the trained model.

Currently, the model achieves a test accuracy of 87.59%, which is a promising start for this project.

##Features
Hate speech detection: The project detects hate speech in text data, enabling identification of potentially harmful content.
User ban/termination: If feasible, the project aims to take action against users who engage in hate speech, such as banning or terminating their accounts.

##Usage
Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and contains labeled examples of hate speech.
Preprocess the data: Use the provided preprocessing script to clean and transform the text data.
Train the model: Execute the training script to train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Test the model: Run the testing script to evaluate the model's accuracy on a separate test dataset.
Interpret the results: Analyze the model's performance and explore opportunities for improvement.
Please refer to the documentation and code comments for more detailed instructions and usage examples.
