<span style="font-size:18px;">A project to detect hate speech and, if possible, ban/terminate the users.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">This is a project based on data science and machine learning where the data is first cleared using toolkits such as stop words and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), which brings all the words into their natural forms. For example, "driving" will be transformed to "drive," and stop words such as "a," "an," and "the" are removed. This helps the algorithm focus more on the words rather than grammar.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">Then the data is loaded into the code, and through a series of changes, the sentences are further processed, removing unnecessary links, punctuation, and other elements. After this, the machine learning algorithm divides the data into test and train sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the test dataset is used to evaluate its performance.</span>

<span style="font-size:16px;">On testing, the model achieves a test accuracy of 87.59%, which is a promising start for this project.</span>

<span style="font-size:24px;">Features</span>
<span style="font-size:16px;">
- Hate speech detection: The project detects hate speech in text data, enabling the identification of potentially harmful content.
- User ban/termination: If feasible, the project aims to take action against users who engage in hate speech, such as banning or terminating their accounts.

<span style="font-size:24px;">Usage</span>
<span style="font-size:16px;">1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and contains labeled examples of hate speech.</span><br>
<span style="font-size:16px;">2. Preprocess the data: Use the provided preprocessing script to clean and transform the text data.</span><br>
<span style="font-size:16px;">3. Train the model: Execute the training script to train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.</span><br>
<span style="font-size:16px;">4. Test the model: Run the testing script to evaluate the model's accuracy on a separate test dataset.</span><br>
<span style="font-size:16px;">5. Interpret the results: Analyze the model's performance and explore opportunities for improvement.</span>
